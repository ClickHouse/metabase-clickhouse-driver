# Installation

## Download Metabase Jar and Run

1. Download a fairly recent Metabase binary release (jar file) from the [Metabase distribution page](https://metabase.com/start/jar.html).
2. Download the ClickHouse driver jar from this repository's "Releases" page
3. Create a directory and copy the `metabase.jar` to it.
4. In that directory create a sub-directory called `plugins`.
5. Copy the ClickHouse driver jar to the `plugins` directory.
6. Make sure you are the in the directory where your `metabase.jar` lives.
7. Run `MB_PLUGINS_DIR=./plugins; java -jar metabase.jar`.

## Building from Source

Please refer to the extensive documentation available in the Metabase Wiki: [Writing A Driver](https://github.com/metabase/metabase/wiki/Writing-A-Driver)

1. Clone [metabase repository](https://github.com/metabase/metabase)
2. Clone this repository, and follow [the instructions for building the driver](https://github.com/metabase/metabase/wiki/Writing-a-Driver:-Packaging-a-Driver-&-Metabase-Plugin-Basics). Alternatively, download a pre-release jar.
3. Copy `clickhouse.metabase-driver.jar` into your Metabase `plugins` directory
5. Start Metabase, e.g. by invoking `lein run` in your Metabase directory.

If you want to develop simply create a symbolic link from the Metabase `modules/drivers` directory to the root of the driver directory.

## Do the Docker Dance

In an empty directory, create your Dockerfile, e.g. `Dockerfile-clickhouse`

```
FROM metabase/metabase-head:latest
ADD https://github.com/enqueue/metabase-clickhouse-driver/releases/download/0.6/clickhouse.metabase-driver.jar /app/plugins/
```

Assemble

```
docker build -f Dockerfile-clickhouse -t foo/metabase-with-clickhouse .
```

Run

```
docker run --rm -d=false -p 3000:3000 --name metabase foo/metabase-with-clickhouse
```

Please refer to [the fine Metabase operations manual](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/operations-guide/running-metabase-on-docker.html) to find out how to operate a dockerized Metabase with a regular database.
